# Xpiri's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data science projects! I finally decided to post here some of the stuff I have worked on over the past couple of months. After all, <i> done > perfect!</i>

Everyone loves well-made plots! At least I do, that's why every project on this overview page has its own data visualization highlight.

All the different datasets used for these projects are properly documented both in the respective section of this readme file and inside the notebooks themselves. 

The necessary packages can be downloaded via the requirements.txt file. I made sure not to use any (soon-to-be) deprecated functions, so hopefully there will be no reproducibility issues!
