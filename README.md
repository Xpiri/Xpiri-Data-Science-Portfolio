# Xpiri's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data science projects! I finally decided to post here some of the stuff I have worked on over the past couple of months. After all, **done > perfect**! This page will be populated quite slowly, as I can only work on these kind of projects on the weekends. 



Everyone loves well-made plots! At least I do, that's why every project on this overview page has its own data visualization :eyes: highlight.

All the different **datasets** used for these projects are **properly documented** both in the respective section of this readme file and inside the notebooks themselves. 

The necessary packages can be downloaded via the requirements.txt file. I made sure not to use any (soon-to-be) deprecated functions, so hopefully there will be no reproducibility issues!
